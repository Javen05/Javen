## About Projects
My GitHub repository hosts a collection of projects spanning my first two years of study, comprising assignments from school modules, hackathons, and personal endeavors. These projects are publicly accessible in their respective repositories, curated to showcase my skills for my portfolio and provide valuable resources for individuals pursuing a similar field of study. All my public projects are made available for free use, but strictly for non-profit and educational purposes. If utilized, proper credit should be given to acknowledge the source.
